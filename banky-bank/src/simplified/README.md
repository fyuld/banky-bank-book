- Credit Transfers cleared and settled immediatelly, there are no clearing houses.
- Credit Transfers and Card Payments are same, there is no difference, it just works like magic.
- In fact - Credit Transfers are Payments, plain and simple payment from and to account with amount and currency.
- Credit Transfers propagated through same network, there is no SCAN, SWIFT, FedWire. All banks live in world where we agreed on unified transfer mechanism, using BICs and Account Numbers.
- There is no difference between directors of the company and shareholders. All directors get an equal holdings.
